# Direct-Mapped Cache Simulator

**C++ project implementing a direct-mapped cache simulator.**

This program allows you to test cache behavior for different memory addresses and observe hits, misses, and conflict misses.

---

## Features

- Simulates a **direct-mapped cache** with configurable cache size and line size.  
- Test various memory addresses and check results (`Hit`, `Miss`, `MissConflict`).  
- Simple configuration in `main.cpp` – you can change addresses for testing.  
- Easy to extend for larger tests or automated datasets.

## Build

You can build the entire project using **make**:
